## Requirement-to-Section Mapping

| Req ID | Source | Requirement Summary | Response Section | Coverage Notes |
|--------|--------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|
| L-001 | Sec L | [Verbatim or condensed requirement] | [Section #] | [How this section addresses it] |
| L-002 | Sec L | ... | | |
| M-001 | Sec M | [Evaluation criterion] | [Section #, Section #] | [Coverage approach] |
| C-001 | PWS/SOW | [Shall/will statement] | [Section #] | [How addressed] |

## Evaluation Criteria Coverage

| Evaluation Factor | Weight | Sections Covering This Factor | Coverage Assessment |
|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| [Factor 1] | [%/High/Med] | [Section #, #] | Full / Partial / At Risk |
| [Factor 2] | | | |

**Coverage Key:**
- **Full** — Factor is thoroughly addressed across mapped sections
- **Partial** — Factor is addressed but coverage may be thin
- **At Risk** — Factor lacks clear coverage; action required
